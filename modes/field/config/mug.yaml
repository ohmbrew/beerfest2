# This mode counts various hit events and increasingly 'fills' the mug lights every other hit.
# Idea is to enable our game mode qualifier mode when the mug fills up. Thinking of using both
# the beer keg and rim rules saucer holes to start a game mode selection.

# lowest light is tagged with mugfill2-7, and the highest light is tagged with only mugfill7. This results in the
# appropriate set of mug lights lit as the count goes higher.
